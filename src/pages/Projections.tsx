/*
// STANDALONE PROJECTIONS PAGE - COMMENTED OUT
// This page has been commented out as the projections functionality is now integrated into the instances feature
// The code is preserved for future reference

// All the original Projections.tsx code has been moved to InstanceDetail.tsx and AddInstance.tsx
// The comprehensive 40-year projection logic, tax calculations, and analysis features
// are now available through the instances workflow.

// To restore this page in the future, simply uncomment this file and update the routing.
