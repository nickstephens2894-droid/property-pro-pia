/*
// STANDALONE PROPERTY ANALYSIS COMPONENT - COMMENTED OUT
// This component has been commented out as the analysis functionality is now integrated into the instances feature
// The code is preserved for future reference

// All the original PropertyAnalysis.tsx code has been moved to InstanceDetail.tsx and AddInstance.tsx
// The property input forms, calculations, and analysis features are now available through the instances workflow.

// To restore this component in the future, simply uncomment this file and update the imports.
