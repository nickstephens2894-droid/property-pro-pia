# Scenarios Feature - Rollout Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive rollout plan for the Scenarios feature, which allows users to safely experiment with copies of their investment instances.

## Feature Summary

The Scenarios feature enables users to:

- Create scenarios to experiment with different investment strategies
- Copy existing instances into scenarios for safe experimentation
- Create new instances directly within scenarios
- Edit scenario instances without affecting real instances
- View aggregated projections across all instances in a scenario
- Apply changes back to real instances when ready
- Handle conflicts during apply operations

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created

1. **scenarios** - Main scenarios table
2. **scenario_instances** - Copies of instances within scenarios
3. **scenario_applications** - Track apply operations
4. **feature_flags** - Feature flag management

- Performance remains stable
- No critical issues reported

## Feature Flags

### Primary Flags

- `feature:scenarios` - Main scenarios feature
- `feature:scenarios:apply` - Apply functionality
- `feature:scenarios:conflict_resolution` - Conflict resolution

### Rollout Configuration

```sql
-- Phase 1: Internal testing
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = true WHERE flag_name = 'feature:scenarios';
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = true WHERE flag_name = 'feature:scenarios:apply';
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = true WHERE flag_name = 'feature:scenarios:conflict_resolution';

-- Phase 2: Beta users (add user-specific flags)
INSERT INTO user_feature_flags (user_id, flag_name, enabled)
SELECT id, 'feature:scenarios', true
FROM auth.users
WHERE email IN ('beta1@example.com', 'beta2@example.com');

-- Phase 3: Gradual rollout (percentage-based)
-- This would be implemented in the application logic
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Adoption Metrics**

   - Number of scenarios created
   - Number of scenario instances created
   - Number of apply operations
   - User engagement with scenarios

2. **Performance Metrics**

   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Database query performance
   - Memory usage

3. **Error Metrics**

   - Error rates by operation
   - Failed apply operations
   - Conflict resolution failures
   - Database errors

4. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Time to create first scenario
   - Time to apply changes
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Support ticket volume

### Monitoring Setup

```sql
-- Create monitoring views
CREATE VIEW scenario_metrics AS
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as scenarios_created,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_scenarios
FROM scenarios
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

CREATE VIEW apply_metrics AS
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_applications,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 END) as successful_applications,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed_applications
FROM scenario_applications
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if critical issues)

1. Disable feature flags
2. Stop new scenario creation
3. Preserve existing data
4. Notify users of temporary unavailability

### Data Rollback (if data corruption)

1. Restore from backup
2. Re-run migration with data validation
3. Verify data integrity
4. Re-enable feature gradually

### Code Rollback

1. Revert to previous version
2. Disable scenarios routes
3. Hide scenarios from navigation
4. Maintain data for future re-enablement

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- [x] ScenariosContext tests
- [x] Component tests
- [x] Utility function tests

### Integration Tests

- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Database operation tests
- [ ] Feature flag tests

### E2E Tests

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own scenarios
- Scenario instances are isolated by user
- Apply operations are user-scoped

### Conflict Resolution

- Atomic apply operations prevent partial updates
- Conflict detection prevents data loss
- Audit trail for all apply operations

### Feature Flag Security

- Feature flags are read-only for most users
- Admin-only access to modify feature flags
- Audit logging for feature flag changes
